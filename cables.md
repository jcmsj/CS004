| Type | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coaxial | Central conductor surrounded by insulating layer, metal shield, and outer jacket | Immune to EMI, can carry high bandwidth | More expensive than twisted pair cable, more difficult to install |
| Fiber optic | Very thin strands of glass or plastic that transmit light signals | Immune to EMI, can carry very high bandwidth | More expensive than copper cable, more difficult to install |
| Shielded twisted pair (STP) | Two insulated copper wires twisted together and enclosed in metal shield and outer jacket | Good immunity to EMI and crosstalk | More expensive than unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable |
| Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) | Two insulated copper wires twisted together | Less expensive than other types of cable, easy to install | More susceptible to EMI and crosstalk |
